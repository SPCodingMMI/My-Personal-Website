        <h2> Who is Xennoh? </h2>
        <p> I am a Youtuber that does these things called Let's Plays or Walkthroughs where I simply
            play games of my choice, provide guidance, and commentate my personal experiences. My goal
            is to hope that a viewer watch the videos and then tries the game out themselves if they have not played it.
            </p>

        <h2> Xennoh's Favorite Game Of All-Time </h2>
        <p> My favorite game of all-time is Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. As a kid, I played it over
            non-stop and give myself challenges to make the game more enjoyable. It is also the first game  
            that got me into loving Turn-Based RPGs.</p>

        <h2> Xennoh's Schedule </h2>
        <p> I don't really have a schedule to follow with. It was more about when is it necessary to
            do something. Normally, I do a lot of recording session in one day and then edit my videos. 
            After all of that, I post one video per day. </p>

        <h2> Xennoh's Free Time </h2>
        <p> Other than working on my videos, I sometimes do coding to develop skills and knowledge,
            play games, or chill with my friends on discord. </p>
